            The CyberGorilla universe is facilitated around the $GRILLA token. All CyberGorilla holders will passively yield an amount of $GRILLA tokens per day, with those lucky enough to hold one of the 333 Genesis CyberGorilla yielding significantly more $GRILLA tokens.  $GRILLA will serve as a token that can be spent on various utilities such as the exclusive JunglePass and JungleSerum within the CyberGorilla Shop.)

        Once the mint is complete, we still start development of the CyberGorillas ability to breed. This will enable scalability in the project, whilst also providing deflationary mechanics to the initial 3333 supply. Breeding will be capped to 1667 Baby CyberGorillas. Cross-breeding between other ape collections is also something we are in talks of providing, stay tuned.

            The Junglepass will act as a separate NFT in it's own OpenSea listed collection, visible only once the incredibly scarce supply of 100 JunglePasses have been purchased from the CyberGorilla Shop using your yielded $GRILLA tokens. This coveted pass will give you access to the most exclusive discord channels amongst the NFT scene, giving you instant access to presales of NFTs biggest mints. Future utility TBA.

            JungleSerum acts as an instigator between the two CyberGorillas you decide to breed. Purchasable only via the CyberGorilla Shop, using the JungleSerum you are permitted to breed between two CyberGorillas that will contain a mixture of the traits possessed by it's parents along with additional future utility. Oh, I think we forgot to mention, the breeding cap of Baby CyberGorillas is very limited, at 1667. Be warned, some CyberGorillas die during pregnancy

            We recognise the importance of marketing amongst NFT projects and plan to continue driving hype around the project using powerful marketing campaigns. Overtime, we want to see CyberGorilla holders thrive amongst the market and one of the best ways to do this is through collaborating with similarly successful projects in featured utilities such as cross-breeding. We also recognise that 'influencer campaigns' are highly saturated. With a strong background in marketing, we plan to release a marketing whitepaper highlighting exactly how we set to make CyberGorillas one of NFTs most renowned projects.
