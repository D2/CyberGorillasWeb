We realize that this project is quickly becoming very anticipated. So we have decided to give WL members 24 hours to mint their CyberGorillas to avoid paying gas fees at peak times. Additionally, our developers are working tirelessly to ensure low gas smart contracts. Don't worry, we have your best interests at heart!
