The CyberGorillas is a collection of 3333 randomly generated Cyber-themed Gorillas, featuring 333 Genesis CyberGorillas amongst them. Having been forged amongst an Industrial Smog and dumped into a Dystopian Jungle on the Blockchain, they possess scalable utility and deflationary mechanics. This may be your only chance to get your hands on them.
